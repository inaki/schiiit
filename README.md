# Schiiit

Schiiit is a straightforward Electron-based application, serving as a cheat sheet container. Its conception stemmed from my journey in learning `vim` and developing new motor skills. To make the learning experience more interactive and useful, the navigation and other features of the app are designed to aid the learning process.

# Core Foundations

The project's foundation was laid using `create-react-app`. As it started to take shape, `typescript` and `tailwindcss` were integrated into the build. Finally, it was set up as an `electronjs` app to provide a desktop application experience.

# Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to get Schiiit up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory and run `yarn install`.
3. Open two terminal windows:
    a. Run the React app in the first terminal using `yarn start`.
    b. Start the Electron app in the second terminal with `yarn electron`.

Voila! Enjoy your Schiiit experience.
